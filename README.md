## About

This task is meant to evaluate candidates frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, React) knowledge.

## Instructions

- Show us what you got ðŸ’ª
- Create a merge request and let us know

## Requirements

- Design should look as close to the given design, as possible;
- Design must be responsive;
- App should work on modern browsers;
- Encouraged to use pre-processors for CSS, but that's optional;
- Email & password validation (not empty, valid email format);
- Make a _fake_ api call to login the user (only valid credentials of email: `frontend@isawesome.com`, password: `cool`);
- Store credentials to `localStorage`, so you wouldn't need to re-login later;
- Throw a greeting message if login was successful or user had credentials in `localStorage`;

## Tips

- Using `create-react-app` is ok, but we prefer to see your own solution;
- If you know `redux`, use it;
- We love clean code with good structure!
